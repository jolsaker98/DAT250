## Technical problems encountered

During this assignment there was not any big technical problems that was encountered. There was one thing though, which made me feel stupid after a while. I did not have the Intellij ultimate edition, which I did not remember was needed and we had access to before it was published on canvas. After that it was a very quick fix.

## Database tables

Below is a screenshot of a diagram of the database created. There was a problem where I had 9 tables instead of the 7 wanted. To fix this i added mappedBy to define the reference side and fix the table duplication problem.
