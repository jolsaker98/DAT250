## Technical problems encountered

During this assignment there was not any big technical problems that was encountered. There was one thing though, which made me feel stupid after a while. I did not have the Intellij ultimate edition, which I did not remember was needed and we had access to before it was published on canvas. After that it was a very quick fix.
