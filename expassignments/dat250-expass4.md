Only did the first two experiments that was mandatory

## Technical problems

While I had no particular problems during installation I found some problems while I was trying to access localhost:8080. I have previously used that port for CD/CI tool which higged that while i was doing this project. It took a while to remove that from the computer and free up that port.
